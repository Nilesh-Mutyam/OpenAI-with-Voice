/*
give me line by line explanation for OpenAI.js

Sure, here's a line by line explanation of the code in the OpenAI.js file:

python

import axios from 'axios';

This line imports the axios library, which is a popular JavaScript library for making HTTP requests.

javascript

const OpenAI = (input) => {
  const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    axios
      .post('https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/davinci/jobs', {
        prompt: input,
        max_tokens: 100,
        temperature: 0.5,
      })
      .then((res) => {
        resolve(res.data.choices[0].text);
      })
      .catch((err) => {
        reject(err);
      });
  });
  return promise;
};

export default OpenAI;

This block of code declares a new function called OpenAI, which takes an input parameter. The function returns a new Promise object, which will be resolved or rejected depending on the outcome of the HTTP request to the OpenAI API.

The axios.post method is used to make a POST request to the OpenAI API with the input as the prompt, a maximum number of tokens to generate as 100, and a temperature of 0.5.

If the request is successful, the Promise will be resolved with the first text choice from the API response. If the request fails, the Promise will be rejected with the error.

Finally, the function is exported as the default export from the file, allowing it to be imported and used in other parts of the application.
