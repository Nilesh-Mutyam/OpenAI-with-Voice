  /*
  give me line by explaination for TextToSpeech.js

Sure, here's a line by line explanation of the code in the TextToSpeech.js file:

javascript

const TextToSpeech = (text) => {
  responsiveVoice.speak(text, 'UK English Male', {
    rate: 0.7,
  });
};

export default TextToSpeech;

This block of code declares a new function called TextToSpeech, which takes a text parameter.

The responsiveVoice.speak method is used to generate speech from the given text, using the UK English Male voice and a speech rate of 0.7.

Finally, the function is exported as the default export from the file, allowing it to be imported and used in other parts of the application.
